# a4 Assignment 4

A separate NetBeans project has been provided for each assignment question. Before you start your work, ensure that you have cloned this repository and created a develop branch. When you have completed the assignment, commit to your develop branch and create a pull request.

### Problem 1

Write a Java/Swing program that performs Decimal to Binary and Binary to Decimal conversion. The top part of the frame allows the user to input a decimal number. When the "CONVERT" button is pressed, the binary equivalent is displayed. Likewise the lower part of the frame converts from Binary to Decimal. Your program needs to work on numbers in the 0 - 255 range, and provide appropriate feedback if a value outside of that range is entered. For the conversion, you need to write your own methods for the number/base conversions (i.e. DO NOT use the available built-in functions ... write them yourself). Your frame should look similar to the following:

### Problem 3

Write a program that calculates the Binary Coefficient, C(n,r). This value is given by the expression:
```
   n!
--------
r!(n-r)!
```
Your program should contain to have a method for calculating the factorial.
